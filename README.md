# Welcome to my Pokemon game :fire: :fire: :fire:

In short, the basis of this game involves the usage of the pokemonNames pip package 
to generate a pokemon and together with OOP; defined classes, methods and instances
create a game loop to catch pokemon, save them to a SQL database, 
as well as load player and pokemon data from the database.
